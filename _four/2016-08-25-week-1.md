## What we did
- This

## What we will do
- Schedule meeting times
- Establish process
- Build Domain Model

## Needs
- Access to source
  - IVPP or IdeaTools
- “Although the original source code… is still available… a new program… needs to be created”
  - We’re extending IVPP v1 not rewriting. Correct?
- Scope / Previous Work
  - What does IdeaTools provide?
  - What does IVPP provide?
  - What’s missing?
  - Priorities
  - Internationalization?
  - User Experience
- Improved in what way?
  - Do existing IVPP features need improved UX?
  - Demo of both IdeaTools & IVPP
- Importing Data
  - What data do we currently import? Is there anything missing?
  - What data is important from the BYU corpus / dictionary API? How is it used?
  - Are we importing lessons from IdeaTools?
- Contact frequency / preferences
- Access to Study
  - What metrics did the study measure to come up with the 66% improvement?
  - What was the sample size used?
- “The team will be responsible for providing support for the existing application”
  - What sort of support? Operational? Bugfixing? etc.
  - Priority of support over features?
- “Must have recording and playback capability with captioning”
  - Who is recording?
  - Who is captioning?

## Risks
- Technical Debt
- The project doesn’t entirely do what we think it does. “It only kinda works” syndrome.
- Lack of domain knowledge
