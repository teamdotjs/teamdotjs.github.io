# Background Information
The NTID (National Technical Institute for the Deaf) Department of Liberal Studies at RIT provides direct English Language Instruction to approximately 400 students, and offers about 35 to 45 sections of English each year. These English language courses focus on review of aspects of English grammar, vocabulary, reading, and writing for academic purposes.

# Project Description
Until last year (2013­14), direct vocabulary instruction and practice was fully supported by an interactive vocabulary practice program delivered through the IdeaTools course management platform. This platform was developed specifically for NTID students, by Deaf and Hearing faculty to make use of visual representations of many auditory concepts.
The vocabulary program was designed to operate within the IdeaTools platform. The program was up and running for almost 6 years in the current form during which time a lengthy vetting process was taking place; a process that developed, tested, and continuously modified and improved the capability of the interactive aspects of the program.
Last year, NTID Administration announced that support for the IdeaTools platform would be discontinued and that the materials from IdeaTools courses would be migrated to the MY COURSES platform in use at RIT. Over the course of the past 20 months, the MY COURSES platform has been unable to successfully migrate the materials and interactive program developed for vocabulary instruction from IdeaTools.
This project utilizes Ruby On Rails, PostgreSQL, Circle CI, and Heroku to operate the existing project. The team will be provided full access to the project’s accounts on github, heroku, google. Although the original source code for the vocabulary program is still available, a new program that would provide the same or an improved interactive process needs to be created for student use as soon as possible.

# Project Scope
Research conducted on the effectiveness of the interactive vocabulary program has shown that NTID students were able to improve their vocabulary performance by 66% when compared to their deaf counterparts who did not use the interactive vocabulary program.
This project proposal seeks to expand upon a previous senior project’s work to replace the extant IdeaTools3 Vocabulary Program as a stand­alone web application that would allow all RIT students direct access to a Vocabulary Practice Program. The existing application will need to be expanded to include video capability and to provide the ability to import data through several external sources, including the Brigham Young University Corpus as well as a dictionary API for importing vocabulary words into the application. This will allow teachers to generate a larger breadth of English grammar and vocabulary which will result in improved practice for students. In addition, the existing
application will require an improved user experience that will make the application simpler to use based on usability studies that the team will conduct on both teachers and students. In addition to adding this new functionality, the team will be responsible for providing support for the existing application. Examples of each portion of the requirements are available to the project team for examination and explanation by the project sponsor.

# Project Challenges
The primary technical challenges for this project include improving an existing program to improve its ability to deliver instruction to a wide range of students, both internally and externally – nationally and internationally. The primary non­technical challenge would be to improve upon a complex previously existing practice program to visually stimulate and improve student vocabulary performance over the course of many weeks of instruction.

# Constraints & Assumptions
Interactive practice pages:
- must be visually interesting
- must follow the established IdeaTools format as an example
- must be accessible to the RIT NTID community but must not preclude a wider audience
- must have recording and playback capability with captioning
