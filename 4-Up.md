## <span id="anchor-6"></span>What we did

This

## <span id="anchor-7"></span>What we will do

-   Schedule meeting times
-   Establish process
-   Build Domain Model

## <span id="anchor-8"></span>Needs

-   Access to source

    -   IVPP or IdeaTools
-   “Although the original source code… is still available… a new
    program… needs to be created”

    -   We’re extending IVPP v1 not rewriting. Correct?
-   Scope / Previous Work

    -   What does IdeaTools provide?
    -   What does IVPP provide?
    -   What’s missing?
    -   Priorities
    -   Internationalization?
-   User Experience

    -   Improved in what way?
    -   Do existing IVPP features need improved UX?
-   Demo of both IdeaTools & IVPP
-   Importing Data

    -   What data do we currently import? Is there anything missing?
    -   What data is important from the BYU corpus / dictionary API? How
        is it used?
    -   Are we importing lessons from IdeaTools?
-   Contact frequency / preferences
-   Access to Study

    -   What metrics did the study measure to come up with the 66%
        improvement?
    -   What was the sample size used?
-   “The team will be responsible for providing support for the existing
    application”

    -   What sort of support? Operational? Bugfixing? etc.
    -   Priority of support over features?
-   “Must have recording and playback capability with captioning”

    -   Who is recording?
    -   Who is captioning?

## <span id="anchor-9"></span>Risks

-   Technical Debt
-   The project doesn’t entirely do what we think it does. “It only
    kinda works” syndrome.
-   Lack of domain knowledge
